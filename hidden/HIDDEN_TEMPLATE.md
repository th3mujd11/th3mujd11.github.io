# This is a hidden page

Drop `.md` files in the `/hidden` folder.

- Access at `/hidden/<filename-without-ext>`
- `title` sets the page title, `date` shows under it
- Set `unlisted: true` if you later add an index and want to hide it there

Example inline code: `echo hello`

```
block code here
```
